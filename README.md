# urn-harvester

This repository contains the code for the national URN identifier harvester by the National Library of Finland.

URNs are globally persistent identifiers used to name resources – such as web pages – so they can be referred to even when their links change or become unavailable. You can find more information on URNs
from the [National Library's wiki](https://www.kiwi.fi/display/URN/In+English) or from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name).

The URN resolver can be found at [urn.fi](https://urn.fi/).
